# Problem settings, especially those given in `problem.json`,
# are no longer defined in this file.
# These settings are now accessed through `problem_model.py`
# using the following approach in python codes:
#   import problem_model as prob
#   a_variable = prob.setting_name()
# or like this in bash scripts:
#   source "${INTERNALS}/problem_util.sh"
#	a_variable="$(get_problem_data 'setting_name')"
